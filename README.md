**Virginia Water Preservation Alliance - The VWPA**

We are the Virginia Water Preservation Alliance (VWPA), a non-profit 501 3(c) student initiative towards preserving the beauty of Virginia's bodies of water and the environments that surround them. We are a new and growing organization with over 40 current volunteers and 5 Fairfax County high schools involved. So far, we have cleaned over 400 gallons of trash in just 4 months of operations!
